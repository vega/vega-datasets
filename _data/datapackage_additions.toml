In his 1973 paper "Graphs in Statistical Analysis" Yale Professor [Francis Anscombe](https://archives.yale.edu/repositories/12/resources/3711) uses these four datasets 
to argue that visualization is essential to good statistical work, not merely an optional supplement. This was a radical position at a 
time when most statistical analysis was done through batch processing on mainframes with no graphical output. Serves 
as a powerful demonstration that identical summary statistics can mask radically different patterns in data, making the case that 
statistical analysis should combine both numerical calculations and graphical examination.

Compares the performance of three antibiotics against 16 different bacteria. Based on graphic designer 
Will Burtin's 1951 visualization of antibiotic effectiveness, originally published in Scope Magazine and
featured as an example in the Protovis project, a precursor to D3.js.

Numerical values represent the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each antibiotic, 
measured in units per milliliter, with lower values indicating higher antibiotic
effectiveness.

As noted in the Protovis example, "Recreating this display revealed some minor errors in the original: \
a missing grid line at 0.01 μg/ml, and an exaggeration of some values for penicillin".

The vega-datsets version is largely consistent with the Protovis version, with one \
correction (changing 'Brucella antracis' to the correct 'Bacillus anthracis') and the addition of a \
new column, 'Genus', to group related bacterial species together.

The caption of the original 1951 [visualization](https://graphicdesignarchives.org/wp-content/uploads/wmgda_8616c.jpg) 
reads as follows:

> #### Antibacterial ranges of Neomycin, Penicillin and Streptomycin
>
>
> The chart compares the in vitro sensitivities to neomycin of some of the common pathogens (gram+ in \
red and gram- in blue) with their sensitivities to penicillin, and streptomycin.
>
> The effectiveness of the antibiotics is expressed as the highest dilution in μ/ml. which inhibits \
the test organism.
>
> High dilutions are toward the periphery; consequently the length of the colored bar is proportional \
to the effectiveness.
>
> It is apparent that neomycin is especially effective against Staph. albus and aureus, Streph. \
fecalis, A. aerogenes, S. typhosa, E. coli, Ps. aeruginosa, Br. abortus, K. pneumoniae, Pr. \
vulgaris, S. schottmuelleri and M. tuberculosis.
>
> Unfortunately, some strains of proteus, pseudomonas and hemolytic streptococcus are resistant to \
neomycin, although the majority of these are sensitive to neomycin.
>
> It also inhibits actinomycetes, but is inactive against viruses and fungi. Its mode of action is \
not understood.

   Hong Kong has been revised to Hong Kong, China in the new version.

"collects, preserves and harmonizes U.S. census microdata" from as early as 1790.

Originally created for a 2006 data visualization project called *sense.us* by IBM Research (Jeff Heer, \
Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Viégas), described [here](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/files/bdata_ch12.pdf). 
The dataset is also referenced in this vega [example](https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/job-voyager/).

Based on a tabulation of the [OCC1950](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/OCC1950) \
variable by sex across IPUMS USA samples. Appears to be derived from Version 6.0 (2015) of \
IPUMS USA, according to 2024 correspondence with the IPUMS Project. IPUMS has made improvements to \
occupation coding since version 6, particularly for 19th-century samples, which may result in \
discrepancies between this dataset and current IPUMS data. Details on data revisions are available \
[here](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/revisions).

IPUMS USA confirmed in 2024 correspondence that hosting this dataset on vega-datasets is permissible, \
stating:
>We're excited to hear that this dataset made its way to this repository and is being used by students \
for data visualization. We allow for these types of redistributions of summary data so long as the \
underlying microdata records are not shared.

1. Represents summary data. Underlying microdata records are not included.
2. Users attempting to replicate or extend this data should use the [PERWT](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/PERWT#description_section) 
(person weight) variable as an expansion factor when working with IPUMS USA extracts.
3. Due to coding revisions, figures for earlier years (particularly 19th century) may not match current \
IPUMS USA data exactly.

These discrepancies align the `monarchs.json` dataset with the start and end dates of the `wheat.json` dataset used in the visualization.
The entry \"W&M\" represents the joint reign of William III and Mary II. While the dataset shows their reign as 1689-1702, 
the official Web site of the British royal family indicates that Mary II's reign ended in 1694, though William III continued to rule until 1702.
The `commonwealth` field is used to flag the period from 1649 to 1660, which includes the Commonwealth of England, the Protectorate, 
and the period leading to the Restoration. While historically more accurate to call this the \"interregnum,\" the field name of `commonwealth` 
from the original dataset is retained for backwards compatibility.

Unemployed persons (Current Population Survey) [are] persons aged 16 years and older who had
no employment during the reference week, were available for work, except for temporary
illness, and had made specific efforts to find employment sometime during the 4-week period
ending with the reference week. Persons who were waiting to be recalled to a job from which
they had been laid off need not have been looking for work to be classified as unemployed.

Derived from the [Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS)](https://www.bls.gov/lau/) program, 
a federal-state cooperative effort overseen by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). 
The LAUS program produces monthly and annual employment, unemployment, and labor force data for census regions and divisions,
states, counties, metropolitan areas, and many cities and towns.
